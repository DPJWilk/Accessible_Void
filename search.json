The wind is a steward. The wind forgets nothing.\nAnd in the fullness of time, all that was cast upward shall descend, not as rain, but as reckoning.”"

These tapes are VHSrecordings that supposedly contain episodes of the various shows that aired on Channel 94. The Odyssey tapes are recognizable by their distinctive purple clamshells, the paper inserts of which depict day-glo pyramids and torii gates. The Odyssey tapes also have physical properties that are unexplainable by science: the content of the tapes can only be viewed at night, and cannot be transferred to any other medium; attempting to watch one during the day or from an internet upload have all failed—the image just shows a blank, blue screen. Supposedly.\n\n\n\n\nHistorical Notes\n\n\nNo one knows who made the Odyssey tapes, or if they are still being made.\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\nSee also:\n\n\nDeep Lake, New Mexico\n\n\nTV Odyssey Station"

Rest in peace dad.\n\n\n\nReply by: JuniperRoad\nThere was a children’s block in the mornings.\nNot cartoons.\nPuppets, maybe? Or masks? Something about a lumberjack\nThe set looked like it was made of painted plywood.\nI remember a character that wasn’t acknowledged by the others. It stood too still.\nThis was before school. Deep Lake Elementary days.\n\n\n\nReply by: HighDesert1990\nOkay but does anyone remember the weather segment?\nIt wasn’t local weather.\nIt was just the lake.\nCamera pointed at the water.\nA voice listing temperatures that didn’t match ours.\n“Humidity: rising.”\nThat’s all I remember.\n\n\n\nReply by: LakebedLurker\nThe late movie slot.\nNot actual movies.\nLong static shots.\nParking lot at night.\nEmpty grocery aisle.\nA hallway that might have been the high school but wasn’t.\nMy older brother insists there were actors, but I never saw any.\n\n\n\nReply by: DesertStatic\nThere was a talk show, right?.\nSmall desk.\nTwo chairs.\nSometimes only one person in the room.\nI don’t remember interviews.And the host, Joe something?\nThe camera would stay on the empty chair longer than felt normal.\n\n\n\nReply by: AnalogKid\nStation IDs between programs:\nWhite circle.\nBlack background.\nA tone that dipped slightly at the end.\nNo call letters.\nJust “94.”\nBut the 9 looked wrong.\n\n\n\nReply by: MesaMom73\nMy husband grew up outside Deep Lake and says none of this sounds like real programming.\nWhich is fair.\nIt was just… what was on.\n\n\n\nReply by: CarlFromCarl’sHardware\nThere was a sports recap once.\nDeep Lake High wasn’t playing that night.\nNo one was.\nBut the scoreboard said 17–17.\nI remember that because it stuck.\n17–17.\n\n\n\nReply by: SandiaStatic\nDoes anyone remember commercials?\nI don’t.\nMaybe that was the point, man I miss the 90’s.\n\n\n\nReply by: JuniperRoad\nYes.\nNo commercials.\nOr maybe ads for local businesses that don’t exist anymore.\nI vaguely remember Carl’s Hardware.\nSorry, Carl.\n\n\n\nReply by: CarlFromCarl’sHardware\nWe’ve never advertised on television.\nEver.\n\n\n\nReply by: HighDesert1990\nThe weirdest part to me:\nNo one ever mentioned watching 94 outside of actually watching it.\nIt never came up at school.\nNever came up at church.\nIt was just silently understood that you could turn to it.\nAnd then one day you couldn’t.\n\n\n\nReply by: LakebedLurker\nI asked my older cousin (still lives in Deep Lake) what he remembered besides Odyssey.\nHe said:\n“Not sure what you mean.”\nThen he wouldn’t elaborate.

    "text": "Posted by: OldLakeArchivist\nFebruary 1, 2004\nFor newcomers:\nYes, Channel 94 existed in Deep Lake.\nYes, multiple people have come across what seem original Odyssey tapes.\nNo, they cannot be duplicated (we’ve tried VHS-to-VHS, VHS-to-digital, direct capture, etc.).\nYes, the “fire” story is the official explanation.\nNo, there are still no records of the building.\nPlease read the pinned posts before asking if this is an ARG.\n\n\nReply by: JuniperRoad\nAdding to the test log:\nWe tried digitizing Tape 3 again last night. Standard RCA out to capture card.\nPlayback on the VCR = normal (after 11 p.m., obviously).\nCapture feed = full blue screen.\nAudio file = blank. Not even static.\nThe tape itself still works afterward. No degradation.\n\n\n\nReply by: MesaMom73\nMy sister drove her tape out to Las Cruces last year to see if it was a “location thing.”\nTape works fine everywhere, just when the clock strikes 6 (a.m.) the thing stops working.\nMake of that what you will.\n\n\n\nReply by: SandiaStatic\nFor clarity:\nIt’s not just that they can’t be copied.\nIt’s that the copy knows it’s a copy.\nWe hooked two VCRs together in my garage (yes, Deep Laker, born and raised).\nThe source tape displayed fine on the TV.\nThe recording deck showed blue on its own tiny preview screen while recording.\nLike it refuses to see it.\n\n\n\nReply by: CarlFromCarl’sHardware\nI still think it has something to do with the broadcast itself, not the tape.\nChannel 94 wasn’t cable. It wasn’t satellite. It just… appeared on UHF.\nMy dad’s old Zenith only picked it up if the rabbit ears were angled toward the lake.\nNot the water tower.\nThe lake.\n\n\n\nReply by: HighDesert1990\nWe’ve mapped this already. There are too many supposedly certain places the station was supposed to be. The lake’s empty, as are all the other places.\nWhat I find interesting is that no outside ever found a tape.\nThey’re not on eBay.\nThey’re not in thrift stores.\nThey don’t show up in estate sales.\nThey circulate house-to-house, or just, show up.\n\n\nReply by: LakebedLurker\nCan we stop pretending the fire makes sense?\nMy aunt worked at the Sentinel in ’95.\nShe remembers being told not to “overreport” it.\nHer words.\nOverreport what? A building fire in a town this small would’ve been front page for weeks.\nInstead we got two paragraphs and a chili cook-off.\n\n\n\nReply by: DesertStatic\nWe pulled NOAA weather logs for the supposed night of the fire.\nNo smoke reports.\nNo wind anomalies.\nNo emergency band chatter archived.\nDeep Lake is flat. You’d see smoke from anywhere.\n\n\n\nReply by: JuniperRoad\nHas anyone else noticed the tapes feel warm?\nNot hot. Just… slightly above room temperature.\nEven when they haven’t been played in years.\nMine’s been in a plastic bin since 2004. Still warm.\n\n\n\nReply by: MesaMom73\nYes.\nAnd heavier than blank VHS tapes from the same era.\nWe weighed them in 2022. Average blank VHS: ~180g.\nOdyssey tapes: ~214g.\nBefore anyone asks, yes, same brand casing.\nNo, we’re not opening one.\nWe agreed on that.\n\n\n\nReply by: AnalogKid\nSmall correction:\nWe agreed on that after what happened to Tom.\n\n\n\nReply by: SandiaStatic\nWe’re avoiding content discussion here, but for documentation:\nThe “blue screen if watched before 11 p.m.” rule is consistent across 17 confirmed tapes.\n11:00 p.m. Mountain Time.\nNot adjusted for daylight savings.\nWe tested that twice.\n\n\n\nReply by: CarlFromCarl’sHardware\nChannel 94 used to sign off at 3:17 a.m.\n3:17, exact.\nDoes anyone remember that tone right before it cut?\n\n\n\nReply by: LakebedLurker\nYes.\nAnd the way the clouds looked during sign-off.\nNot ours.\nStop saying it was ours.\n\n\n\nReply by: OldLakeArchivist\nOne more record anomaly:\nProperty parcel for “DL Broadcasting” still appears in 1994 tax rolls.\nAssessed value: $0.\nStructure description: “non-permanent.”\nBy 1996, parcel number reassigned to open land.\nCoordinates redacted."
